# Vector-Space-Model

The query processing of VSM is quite tricky, you need of optimize every aspect of computation.
The high-dimensional vector product and similarity values of query (q) and documents (d) need to
optimized.
Basic Assumption for Vector Space Model (VSM) Retrieval Model
1.Simple model based on linear algebra. Terms are considered as features using a weighting
scheme.
2.Allows partial matching of documents with the queries. Hence, able to produce good institutive
scoring. Continuous scoring between queries and documents.
3.Ranking of documents are possible using relevance score between document and query.
